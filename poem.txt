There is beauty in a moment when it cannot be described
Truth cultivates within yourself instantaneously
It is then, that you crystallize the essence of matters without speech
But,
These moments are rare
To repeat this task at will, one must investigate the root of that truth
If the truth is realized, light from the farthest star can illuminate oneself within
